☐ Make the database storage more advanced so that files can be shared between users and groups (currently the program is a single user login, this is to make the file sharing easier for the time being).
☐ Add more share types, e.g. with password.
☐ Delete cached thumbnails after a certain time.
☐ Return share status on files and directories.
☐ Fix the way the view file page gets file data on the server side.
