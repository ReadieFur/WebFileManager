Todo:
    ☐ Check if a config already exists. If it does, set the default values to the existing values.
    ☐ Make the database storage more advanced so that files can be shared between users and groups.
    ☐ Add more share types, e.g. with password.
    ☐ Delete cached thumbnails after a certain time.
    ☐ Return share status on files and directories.
    ☐ Fix the way the view file page gets file data on the server side.
    ☐ Speed improvements.
    ☐ Fix errors that display when updating a password, though it was likley succecssful the reload causes an error because the token is now invalid.
    ☐ Have shared directories use the folder name in the title and meta tags instead of the share ID.
    ☐ Add an option for the user to limit the download speed of files, this could be useful if they are running the program on a personal network and they don't want this program to saturate their bandwidth.

Done:
